If you have not done so already, install both Micropython on your EV3 robot and Microsoft Visual Studion following the instructions provided by lego education.

[LEGO Education's Install Instructions](https://education.lego.com/en-us/product-resources/mindstorms-ev3/teacher-resources/python-for-ev3)

In this lesson, we will use the python program saved from the simulator in lesson #1 to program the EV3 bot which moves the food into the M08 scoring circle.

1. Turn on the EV3 bot and wait for Micropython to finish booting
2. Start Microsoft Studio Code
3. Click the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Micropython Icon on the left hand side of Microsoft Studio Code and then click "Create a new project."  Name the project "lesson2"
4. Click File->Open File and open the Python program you saved from the simulator.
5. If the EV3 robot is not configured for WiFi, connect a USB cable to the EV3 robot for programming
6. In Visual Studio Code connect to the EV3 robot by clicking "EV3DEV DEVICE BROWSER" then "Click here to connect to a device" and then click on the device.  When connected a green circle should appear next to the ev3dev robot under the "EV3DEV DEVICE BROWSER."
7. Download the workspace to the ev3dev robot by clicking the download icon which appears when hovering your mouse over "EV3DEV DEVICE BROWSER"
8. Once the code is downloaded onto the EV3 robot, use the buttons to navigate to your project folder and select&run the python program.
